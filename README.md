### Motivation

#### Scenario 1
You are walking towards Central Library, ready to embark on a productive day of working on your software side projects. You find a seat and settle down, reaching out for your laptop and its charger. That’s when it hits you. Your charger is at home, which is an hour’s commute away. You don’t want to waste time going back home, so you are left with one option. Borrow a charger. There are bound to be people in your vicinity with a charger compatible with your device. Nonetheless, some are willing to lend and others not. So who are you going to approach? What if there was an easier way to find out who has the accessories you require, so as to streamline the search? (CS2040S *cough* *cough*)

#### Scenario 2
You are an NUS Computer Science student compelled by the school to take a module to fulfill your Unrestricted Electives. You decided to take up Spanish 1. Little did you know, the first project, which contributes 40% to your overall grade, is a Photo Montage Project. The project requires high quality photos that have to be taken on a DSLR. As someone not keen on investing in an expensive camera, you pray for some rare kind soul to lend you their camera. But how do you find this kind soul…where would you go? Not everyone is willing to lend you their precious camera. What if there is a way for you to simply search for what expensive items that you need, rent it for a price from a willing party, and return once you are done?

### Aim

We envision a mobile application that allows for seamless borrowing/lending/renting within communities.

### Features

The Mobile Application (compatible with both iOS and Android) first brings the user to a login/register page. After they log in, they will be directed to a landing page. 

#### Landing Page + Feed
The landing page contains a search bar in the middle
Users can scroll below the search bar to view item listings either
Ranked by proximity of the user listing the item, OR
By friends they follow on the application

#### Searching for items
Users will be able to search for items to either
Borrow from those in their direct vicinity, for a short period of time (within a day), OR
Rent from anybody within Singapore, for an extended period of time (specified by the user, and agreed upon by the renter)
When searching, users can specify the following
Item being looked for
Period of time that the user is looking to borrow/rent the product
Price range of listing (Optional field for items being rented)
The ranking of search results will depend on the following factors
Reviews of renter
Location
Price range (input by the person searching, only applicable for items being rented)

#### Chat
Before dealing with the lender/renter, users can chat with them to coordinate places to meet up to obtain the item listed, or for general purposes i.e. enquiries

#### Profile page and Listings
Users can navigate to their profile page, where their current item listings are displayed
Item listings refer to products that the user is willing to lend/rent
These will contain information such as
Whether the item is up for borrowing or renting
Period of time that the user listing is willing to share that product
Price of the listing (for items being rented)
Users can add, remove or edit listings
Users can add other users as friends by visiting their profile

#### Share Credits
Each user would have a certain amount of Share Credits when an account is created, which is displayed on their individual profiles
Share Credits would:
Increase every time a user lends an item to another party
Decrease every time the user borrows from another party
User will not be allowed to borrow once reaching a certain Share Credit floor
This incentivises users to lend their own items so that they are able to borrow more
**Note that Share Credits are not affected by listings that involve monetary transaction (renting)

#### Reviews:
After each transaction is made (borrowing/lending or renting), users are prompted to leave a review for the other party
Reviews and ratings would be shown on each user’s profile
This assures users of the credibility of other parties
It also reduces the likelihood of errant / irresponsible users who would undermine the overall quality of services on our app
